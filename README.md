# RockAround

This is my 4th Year final year project written using Java and Android Studio.
I created a mobile application that allows musicians and bar owners to sign up and search for eachother.
The main purpose of this project was to create a proof of concept application that allows both artists and venue owners from all backgrounds to communicate and collaborate.
The application follows the industry standard MVVM architecture and uses Firestore for the apps database.
